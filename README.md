# hello-world
My first non-Learn.co repository! Using the github guide.

Although I've completed the Flatiron School's "Intro to Javascript" online course, I know I've barely scratched the surface.
I'm slowly becoming aware of what's really out there in the world of coding.
So far I've learned the relationships between HTML, CSS, and Javascript, plus some (very) basics of how to write/manipulate each.
Figured it was time to figure out github.

Next stop--???
